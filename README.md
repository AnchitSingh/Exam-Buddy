## The Problem: Stop Studying What You Already Know

Ever been stuck on a single, tricky topic while preparing for an exam?

This project was born from a real frustration. While studying for a test, I was weak in **"fixed prepositions."** I searched for practice materials, but all I found were:
- Long articles (passive reading that didn't stick)
- Generic mock exams where only 2 out of 50 questions were relevant
- Hours wasted on topics I already knew

**This is a universal problem.** Traditional study methods spray content everywhere‚Äîyou hit everything, but your specific weak spots get little attention.

### Exam Buddy is your laser-focused study tool

It's a precision instrument designed to eliminate your specific knowledge gaps. Instead of doing another generic test, you can create a focused, personalized quiz on the *exact* topic you're struggling with‚Äîinstantly.

**Core Mission:** Empower you to practice smarter, not just harder, by turning any content into a targeted, adaptive learning experience.

Exam Buddy leverages Chrome's extension platform and cutting-edge on-device AI:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "User's Browser (100% On-Device)"
        A[User Action <br/>(Right-click, Button)] --> B{Service Worker <br/>(background.js)};
        B --> C{Side Panel <br/>(React UI)};
        C --> D{Content Extractor};
        B --> E{Content Script <br/>(content.js)};
        E --> F[Webpage/PDF];
        F --> D;

        G --> H{API Service <br/>(api.js)};
        H --> I[On-Device AI Core <br/>(chrome.ai)];
        I --> H;
        H --> C;
    end
```

### Architecture Components:

1. **Side Panel (React UI)** - Modern, interactive user interface in the browser's side panel
2. **Service Worker** - Orchestrates extension lifecycle, context menus, and inter-component communication
3. **Content Script** - Injected into web pages to securely extract HTML, text, and metadata
4. **Content Extraction Pipeline:**
   - **Readability:** Cleans cluttered pages to extract core content
   - **Chunking:** Breaks long documents into manageable pieces
   - **Summarization:** Uses on-device AI to condense text into key points
5. **On-Device AI Core** - Chrome's `LanguageModel` API handles all generation (quizzes, stories, feedback, evaluation)
