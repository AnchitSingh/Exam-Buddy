## The Problem: Stop Studying What You Already Know

Ever been stuck on a single, tricky topic while preparing for an exam?

This project was born from a real frustration. While studying for a test, I was weak in **"fixed prepositions."** I searched for practice materials, but all I found were:
- Long articles (passive reading that didn't stick)
- Generic mock exams where only 2 out of 50 questions were relevant
- Hours wasted on topics I already knew

**This is a universal problem.** Traditional study methods spray content everywhere—you hit everything, but your specific weak spots get little attention.

### Exam Buddy is your laser-focused study tool

It's a precision instrument designed to eliminate your specific knowledge gaps. Instead of doing another generic test, you can create a focused, personalized quiz on the *exact* topic you're struggling with—instantly.

**Core Mission:** Empower you to practice smarter, not just harder, by turning any content into a targeted, adaptive learning experience.
