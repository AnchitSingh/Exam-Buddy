      "answer": "Reversible processes are idealized processes that occur infinitesimally slowly, always in thermodynamic equilibrium. The total entropy of the universe remains constant during a reversible process (second law of thermodynamics). Irreversible processes occur quickly, deviating from equilibrium, resulting in an increase in the total entropy of the universe. The entropy of the system and surroundings increases during irreversible processes.",
